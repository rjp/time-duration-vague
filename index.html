<h1> time-duration-vague</h1>
<h2>Be vague about time durations</h2>
<p>
For example, if a duration is within 10% (capped to 5 minutes) of a nice duration (multiples of 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes, etc.), t-d-v will report it as "nearly N minutes" (if it's below) or "just past N minutes" (if above). A 5% span (capped to 2.5 minutes) will count as the time itself ("N minutes").
</p>
<h2>Example return values</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Seconds <th>Duration </tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 30 <td>just now </tr>
<tr><td>175 <td>nearly 3 minutes </tr>
<tr><td>200 <td>3 and a bit minutes </tr>
<tr><td>265 <td>nearly 5 minutes </tr>
<tr><td>550 <td>nearly 10 minutes </tr>
</table>

irc_muc - gateway between IRC and XMPP MUC</tt>

<p>
Pretends to be an IRC server so you can use your favourite IRC client or bot
in XMPP MUC conferences without rewriting the messaging backend.
</p>
<p>
The only change necessary is to authenticate against the IRC server with your
XMPP credentials.
